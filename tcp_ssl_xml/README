This folder is about TCP communication using OpenSSL and Mini-XML.

If the certificate and private key are out of date, please use the following command to generate new ones. 
	openssl genrsa -out privkey.pem 2048
	openssl req -new -x509 -key privkey.pem -out cacert.pem -days 1095
Of course, you should have installed OpenSSL and Mini-XML for PC and ARM.

Move into tcp_ssl_xml, and type 
	gcc -o tcp_ssl_xml_client tcp_ssl_xml_client.c -lssl -lcrypto -lmxml -lpthread
	gcc -o tcp_ssl_xml_server tcp_ssl_xml_server.c -lssl -lcrypto -lmxml -lpthread
to generate binary files for PC, and change gcc to arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc, for instance, to generate binary files for BBBs. Maybe you should also point out the path of Mini-XML library for ARM, when cross-compiling. Here is /home/dhlinux/mxml-2.7ARM. 
So it should be like arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc -o tcp_ssl_xml_server tcp_ssl_xml_server.c -L/home/dhlinux/mxml-2.7ARM -lssl -lcrypto -lmxml -lpthread

Type ./tcp_ssl_xml_server 8080 5 cacert.pem privkey.pem
	./tcp_ssl_xml_client 127.0.0.1 8080 25 30
to run them on PC, and change 127.0.0.1 to the ip address of server. Here, 5 is the connection maximum of the server. 25 and 30 are the Low and High limits of temperature correspondingly.

File "data" is only for test on PC.
